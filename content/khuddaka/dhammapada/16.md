Ayoge yuñjam-attānaṃ, yogasmiñca ayojayaṃ,  
atthaṃ hitvā piyaggāhī, pihetattānuyoginaṃ.

- 專事不當事，不事於應修，棄善趨愛欲，卻羨自勉者。
- *Joining oneself to distraction, not joining oneself to concentration, abandoning one's goal and seizing what is pleasant, one envies the one who applies himself to the goal.*

> - Dhp-a confirms that *yuñjam* and *ayojayaṃ* are nom sg present participles, one of the simplex verb and the other of the causative, with no obvious difference in meaning between them.
> - With *attānuyoginaṃ* cf. Udāna-v *arthayogine*, PDhp *atthānuyogināṃ*, GDhp *arthaṇupaśiṇo*, note the alternation *tt/tth/rth*. It would seem that a contrast is implied between one who has abandoned the goal and one who applies himself to it, and it is therefore probable that the correct reading is *atthānuyoginaṃ* “applying himself to the goal, or his own interests”, and the text has been affected by *attānam* in pāda a “one having application of himself”, i.e. “applying himself”. Alternatively we might see *atta &lt;   āpta* “what has been obtained” or &lt; *ātta* “what has been taken up”.
> - For *pihet'* (cty *piheti*), see the note on 94.

Mā piyehi samāgañchi, appiyehi kudācanaṃ,  
piyānaṃ adassanaṃ dukkhaṃ, appiyānañca dassanaṃ.

- 莫結交愛人，莫結不愛人，不見愛人苦，見憎人亦苦。
- *Do not at any time associate withe pleasant (or) unpleasant things. Not seeing pleasant things is painful, and also seeing unpleasant things.*

> - For the explanation of the negtive injunctive *mā samāgañchi* by the optative *na samāgaccheyya*, see the note on 133.

##### 211

Tasmā piyaṃ na kayirātha, piyāpāyo hi pāpako,  
ganthā tesaṃ na vijjanti, yesaṃ natthi piyāppiyaṃ.

- 是故莫愛著，愛別離為苦，若無愛與憎，彼即無羈縛。
- *Therefore one should not treat anything as pleasant, for the loss of the pleasant is evil. There are no bonds for those for whom there is neither pleasant nor unpleasant.*

> - For the violation of the two morae rule in *piyāppiyaṃ*, see the note on 70.

piyato vippamuttassa, natthi soko kuto bhayaṃ?
